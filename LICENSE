In the code above, replace your_org_name with your organization's name and your_package_name with your package's name. You can also replace MIT with the license you prefer, such as BSD, Apache 2.0, or another open-source license.

Make sure you include a copy of the full license text (in this case, the MIT License) in a separate file within your package, typically named LICENSE. You should also provide a notice in your package's README.md file indicating the license you've chosen and include a link to the full license text in the LICENSE file. This makes it clear to users and developers how your code can be used and distributed.

Please note that if you're unsure about which license to choose or if you have specific legal or licensing requirements, it's a good idea to consult with a legal professional to ensure your choice aligns with your project's goals.
